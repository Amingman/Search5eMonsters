# Search5eMonsters

## About
A simple tool to search 5e SRD monsters using keywords found in their actions, abilities and legendary action.

Static web server deployed [here on Github Pages.](https://amingman.github.io/Search5eMonsters/)

Monster data obtained from [open5e API.](https://github.com/open5e/open5e-api)


## How to use
Simply type in the search term (case insensitive) in the input box and click 'search'.

For now, you can search with multiple keywords and it will search for the keywords individually.

- e.g. "time Round" will do a search for "time" and "Round" separately

All monster names with the keyword will be displayed.
